# Week 9 
## ArcGIS WorkForce
- Open AGOL
- Next to your name there's ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/4decabc6-cbbf-4d77-8952-e411d9d4df46) Click on it and find ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/e04ab408-49fe-42eb-99d2-36cdef3cad7d)
- You could see ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/26283d63-1bb7-4db7-a77f-6cc93fe2e0a7) Click on it and Name your project and Create Project.
- Add Assignment types (As many as you want) and add workers to the assignemnt. (I assigned myself for testing)

- After adding the assignment type and workers we could start working on the map

### ArcGIS WorkForce Map
-  We could create assignments by clicking on ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/dd16f0bd-2320-4874-affb-3e6003260139)
- Creating an Assignment and assigning it to a worker is very easy (The Blue pin is the new assignment location)

- WorkForce has a mobile application. The assigned person (if the notifications are on for the app) would get a notification that they have been assignemd for an assignment.

- Clicking on the notification -- or opening the WorkForce Application would show them the Assignment that they have been assigned to.

- The person assigned to a job could Accept the job or Decline it.

- The application also has the option to use Google maps or phone maps to show the directions to the assignment area which I found very interesting.

### WorkForce WebApp
- The manager can track on the WebApp if the job was completed or not by going to the project and checking the Status.

- They could also filter the status type they wish to see by going to ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/3a2a7c13-68cc-4b41-b151-77c1a18379e7) and ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/2680a6e1-0bd3-4bbb-8561-baf4ac92c5e1) choosing one of these status options. 

### WorkForce Data on AGOL
- To see the data we could simply go to the layer and open its data.
- Doing so would show us when the assignment was completed, who completed the assignemnt, and if there are any notes that the person added.

- The layer could also be seen using Map Viewer or Map Viewer Classic.

## ArcGIS Solutions (conservation Easement Monitoring)
- In AGOL Find the Solutions Application ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/460dfcfb-584f-4e4b-98cc-efb563592134)
- Find a Solution that works best with your project
- and Deploy it.
`How to deploy a solution --> https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-solutions/latest/get-started/deploy-an-arcgis-solution.htm#GUID-CB97DDF0-613C-4FA1-B8AC-BA0A2CBF671D`

### More about the Solution `https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-solutions/latest/reference/introduction-to-conservation-easement-monitoring.htm`
- I tested and played with multiple solutions -- Sign management, Conservation Easement Monitoring, and Citizen Problem Reporter. However, after looking into the Sign Management and testing it I realized it was not the best solution for our project and started looking more into the Conservation Easement Monitoring.
- This solution requires ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Field Maps, ArcGIS Survery123, and ArcGIS COnnect.
  
### Configuring and testing the solution 
- After deploying the Solution on your account, it would show its content on your AGOL as well as when you go to the Solutions page it will be under _My Solutions_ ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/f05fe459-8ca5-4bbe-a7db-48e0602238ba)
- The deployed Solution has ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/caa7b8da-f8c9-42f7-abea-44b445d43046).
- I created Observation Points ad Conservation Easements area ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/3ac94e8b-3369-40d6-83a9-5867af6a673e) using Map Viewer on AGOL.
- The same map could be used for data collection using Mobile FieldMaps Application -->  ![MicrosoftTeams-image (10)](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/99f30cb7-66eb-45e9-a5fc-dfa40d5c0745)
- This solution also has Dashboards with it which could be modified and edited as the user wishes ![image](https://github.com/LilitMarkarian/geom99/assets/97748633/ed2dadc8-bf7f-4072-bd4d-12ec29264c74)

> Despite the fact that I enjoed deploying this solution and understanding it, I do not think it is a great solution for our client. Comparing this solution with WorkForce, I believe workforce is a better solution for the project.
